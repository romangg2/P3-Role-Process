You should have:

As a **Hiring Manager for a P3 role**, you will be r**esponsible for sourcing, scheduling and taking the 1st phone screen** with candidates in Greenhouse. AKA - you will be the recruiter for your roles.

**Step 1:** Please reach out to **Talent Ops to schedule a training section** for Greenhouse if you never used it before.

    - Make yourself familiar with ****[**Greenhouse**](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Greenhouse-How-To-Guide--Acb4LKi6L5GQ~9frFzeUPbZBAg-Dp8WZmycZ0Ls4S3CRDXTE). This doc will cover:
        - Greenhouse Dashboard
        -  Templates to use
        - How to reject candidates
        - How to move forward with candidates

**Step 2:** Start **sourcing** your candidates using your network or Job sites

    - LinkedIn Messages Samples: [+Examples: LinkedIn Outreach Messages](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Examples-LinkedIn-Outreach-Messages-iKD3YF7NADYAwdiLVfpHA)

**Step 3:** Schedule your own **Phone Screen**

- Using the [GH Guide](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Greenhouse-How-To-Guide--Acb4LKi6L5GQ~9frFzeUPbZBAg-Dp8WZmycZ0Ls4S3CRDXTE)
- [Here is a list of example questions to ask](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Phone-Interviews-Who-covers-what--Ac034xuZK4wANSW8Vi1oGnXFAg-USPNovCPkrU322HdQQfXG)
- **Always ask** candidates if they are **authorized to work in the United States**
- **Do not** ****ask about salary
- Always reject the candidates you don't want to move forward (provide feedback on all Phone screens)

**Step 4:** After the phone screen - Move to **Take-home assignment** (if you have one) **or 1st Onsite**

    - **Talent Ops will schedule all on-site interviews** - T
    - @mention Talent Ops (Roman Guerrero for Tech Roles or Sarah Mangano for Business Roles) in the candidate profile & move them to on-site stage so one of us is notified

**Step 5:** Prior to the onsite the **Recruiting team** will have a **call to discuss compensation** & also manage the **offer** stage.

**Step 6:** Continue like all other roles. **Before the first onsite** happens, there will be a **kickoff** meeting with all the interviewers, recruiter, and HM to go over the focus areas as discussed in the [Hiring Intake](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Example-Hiring-Manager-Intake-Meeting--AcwUY4OWl7wz52BN6KfDfjxJAg-rgkt7JyX993HdOE8DOqLJ).

- After the each onsite, the team will debrief within 24- 48hrs to provide their feedback based on their focus area and decide on hiring.

**Step 7:** Role is **filled** and closed out
